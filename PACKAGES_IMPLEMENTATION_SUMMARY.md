# Packages App Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

### 1. Django App Structure
- Created a new Django app called `packages`
- Added app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py
- Connected URLs to main project URL configuration

### 2. Database Model
**File:** `packages/models.py`
- `Package` model with all required fields:
  - Basic info: name, description, price, currency
  - Features: question_count, validity_days, allowed_attempts, includes_explanations, includes_analytics
  - Status: is_active, tags
  - Timestamps: created_at, updated_at
- Custom `features` property that returns structured feature data
- MySQL compatible (using JSONField for tags)

### 3. API Serializers
**File:** `packages/serializers.py`
- `PackageSerializer`: For API responses with computed features field
- `PackageCreateUpdateSerializer`: For creating and updating packages

### 4. API Views
**File:** `packages/views.py`
- `list_create_packages`: Handles GET (list) and POST (create) operations
- `package_detail`: Handles GET (detail), PUT (update), and DELETE operations
- All endpoints configured with `AllowAny` permissions (no authentication required)
- Consistent JSON response format with status and data fields

### 5. URL Configuration
**File:** `packages/urls.py`
- RESTful URL patterns:
  - `GET/POST /api/packages/` - List all packages or create new package
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/packages/<id>/` - Package detail operations

### 6. Admin Interface
**File:** `packages/admin.py`
- Registered Package model with Django admin
- Custom admin configuration with list display, filters, and search

### 7. Database Migration
- Created and applied initial migration for Package model
- Added sample data (Basic Package)
